# üßπ Hyperdirmic

**Hyperdirmic** is a minimalist background macOS utility that automatically organizes your `Downloads/` folder in real time. It detects new files, categorizes them by type (images, documents, apps, etc.), and moves them into corresponding subfolders.

---

## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ Real-time file detection in your Downloads folder
- ‚úÖ Categorizes files based on MIME type or extension
- ‚úÖ Moves files into clean subfolders (e.g., `Images/`, `Documents/`, `Archives/`, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Lightweight tray icon (menubar utility) with Quit option
- ‚úÖ Works silently in the background

---

## üéØ Future Enhancements (Roadmap)

- ‚è≤Ô∏è Auto-start at login
- ‚öôÔ∏è Preferences menu (folder exclusions, category overrides)
- üñºÔ∏è Customizable tray icon
- üìÑ Activity logging and error tracking
- üîÅ Update mechanism (via Homebrew or Sparkle)
- üåô Dark/light mode tray icon options
- üß™ Rule-based organizing (e.g., "DMGs to Archive after 24 hours")

---

## üõ† Developer Setup

> These steps are for development and building the `.app`, not required for end users.

### üß± Prerequisites

- ‚úÖ Python 3.10+ (recommended)
- ‚úÖ `pip` (comes with Python install)

> üí° macOS does not come with an ideal Python version for development.  
> Download the official installer: [https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/)

Check your versions:

```bash
python3 --version
pip3 --version
```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run (Developer Only)

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourname/hyperdirmic.git
cd hyperdirmic

# Set up a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install app dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# (Optional) Install py2app for packaging
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Run the app
python3 src/organizer.py
```

This will launch a background watcher and show a tray icon in your macOS menu bar.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Current configuration is hardcoded to watch the `~/Downloads` folder and use default subfolders:

| File Type       | Destination Subfolder |
| --------------- | --------------------- |
| Images          | `Images/`             |
| PDFs/Text       | `Documents/`          |
| Archives (.zip) | `Archives/`           |
| Applications    | `Applications/`       |
| Videos          | `Videos/`             |
| Audio           | `Audio/`              |
| Other           | `Other/`              |

In the future, config will be stored in `~/Library/Application Support/Hyperdirmic/config.json`.

## üõ† Development Roadmap

### ‚úÖ Local Development

- [x] Clone the repo
- [x] Create a virtualenv
- [x] Install dependencies
- [x] Run app using `organizer.py`
- [x] Test file drops in `~/Downloads/`
- [x] Verify log output and file movement

---

### ‚úÖ macOS `.app` Bundle with `py2app`

- [x] Install `py2app`:

  ```
  pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
  ```

- [x] Build the app:

  ```
  python setup.py py2app
  ```

- [x] Output: `dist/Hyperdirmic.app`

---

### ‚úÖ Create a Homebrew Cask (Once Deployed)

1. [ ] Zip the app bundle:

   ```
   cd dist
   zip -r Hyperdirmic.zip Hyperdirmic.app
   ```

2. [ ] Calculate the SHA256 hash:

   ```
   shasum -a 256 Hyperdirmic.zip
   ```

3. [ ] Create a GitHub release and upload the `.zip`

4. [ ] In your `homebrew-hyperdirmic` tap:

   - [ ] Create `Casks/hyperdirmic.rb` formula
   - [ ] Fill in metadata and hash

5. [ ] Test with:

   ```
   brew tap yourname/hyperdirmic
   brew install --cask hyperdirmic
   ```

---

## üéØ Future Enhancements (Roadmap)

These are planned or potential features for upcoming versions of Hyperdirmic.

### üì¶ Packaging & Distribution

- [ ] Build signed `.app` with py2app (or switch to Platypus if needed)
- [ ] Zip for GitHub releases
- [ ] Homebrew Cask support:
  - Create `homebrew-hyperdirmic` tap
  - `brew install --cask hyperdirmic`

---

### üßº Internal Functionality Enhancements

## üí° Why "Hyperdirmic"?

Because it's like a **hypodermic needle**... but for **directories**.  
It injects **organization** right into the **veins** of your file system.
